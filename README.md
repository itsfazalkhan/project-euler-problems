## Introduction

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

It is a fantastic resource for sharpening your mathematical and programming skills. This repository aims to provide Python solutions to problems listed in the Archives.

The solutions provided here are intended for educational purposes. While the solutions may provide one correct approach to solving a problem, there are often multiple ways to tackle each problem. I encourage you to understand the problem, explore different approaches, and come up with your own solutions.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/itsfazalkhan/project-euler-problems.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the problem you want to explore:

    ```
    cd project-euler-problems
    ```

3. Each problem is contained within its own directory and has a corresponding Python file named according to the problem number (e.g., `problem_1.py` for Problem 1). You can run the Python file using your preferred Python interpreter:

    ```
    python problem_1.py
    ```

4. The output of the script will typically include the solution to the problem, along with any additional information or prompts.


Each problem has its own directory (`problem_1`, `problem_2`, etc.) containing a Python file with the solution (`problem_1.py`) and a README file (`README.md`) providing additional information about the problem and its solution.
